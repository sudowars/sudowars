Sudowars is a Sudoku app which enables you to play Sudoku in multiplayer mode
over Bluetooth against another person. In addition to that there is also a
trainings mode, where you can play alone. In the trainings mode you can ask for
assistance through the game.

About us: We are a team of german students at the Karlsruher Institute of
Technology. Our task in the context of the module practical software development
was to create a Sudoku application for android phones.
